/**
 * @file zxc_stream.h
 * @brief Multi-threaded streaming compression and decompression API.
 *
 * This header provides the streaming driver that reads from a @c FILE* input and
 * writes compressed (or decompressed) output to a @c FILE*.  Internally the
 * driver uses an asynchronous Producer–Consumer pipeline via a ring buffer to
 * separate I/O from CPU-intensive work:
 *
 * 1. **Reader thread**  – reads chunks from `f_in`.
 * 2. **Worker threads** – compress/decompress chunks in parallel.
 * 3. **Writer thread**  – orders the results and writes them to `f_out`.
 *
 * Extended variants (`_ex` suffix) accept an optional progress callback that
 * is invoked from the writer thread after each block.
 *
 * @see zxc_buffer.h  for the simple one-shot buffer API.
 * @see zxc_sans_io.h for low-level sans-I/O building blocks.
