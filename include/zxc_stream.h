/**
 * @file zxc_stream.h
 * @brief @c FILE*-flavored variants of the ZXC API.
 *
 * Every public entry point that needs @c <stdio.h> lives here, so kernel and
 * freestanding builds can just leave this header out and use @c zxc_buffer.h,
 * @c zxc_pstream.h and the storage-agnostic part of @c zxc_seekable.h.
 *
 * Two subsystems:
 *
 * 1. **Multi-threaded streaming driver**: @c FILE* in, @c FILE* out. A ring
 *    buffer keeps I/O off the CPU-bound work, producer-consumer style:
 *      - reader thread: reads chunks from @c f_in;
 *      - worker threads: compress/decompress chunks in parallel;
 *      - writer thread: reorders the results and writes them to @c f_out.
 *    See @ref zxc_stream_compress, @ref zxc_stream_decompress,
 *    @ref zxc_stream_get_decompressed_size.
 *
 * 2. **Seekable @c FILE* open helper**: wraps a @c FILE* into a thread-safe
 *    @c pread / @c ReadFile-backed @ref zxc_reader_t and hands it to
 *    @ref zxc_seekable_open_reader. See @ref zxc_seekable_open_file.
 *
 * @see zxc_buffer.h   for the simple one-shot buffer API.
 * @see zxc_pstream.h  for single-threaded push-based streaming.
 * @see zxc_seekable.h for the storage-agnostic seekable reader.
