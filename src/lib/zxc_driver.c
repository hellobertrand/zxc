 *        the seekable @c FILE* open helper.
 *
 * Two distinct subsystems live in this translation unit because they share
 * the same userspace-only host requirements (@c <stdio.h>, threading, and
 * platform file-descriptor extraction): keeping them together means a
 * single TU to exclude when building for kernel / freestanding targets.
 *
 *   1. Streaming engine: a ring-buffer producer / worker / consumer
 *      pipeline that parallelises block processing over @c FILE* streams.
 *      Public API: @ref zxc_stream_compress, @ref zxc_stream_decompress,
 *      @ref zxc_stream_get_decompressed_size.
 *
 *   2. Seekable @c FILE* wrapper: builds a @ref zxc_reader_t whose
 *      @c read_at uses @c pread / @c ReadFile on the file descriptor
 *      extracted from a @c FILE*, then delegates to
 *      @ref zxc_seekable_open_reader.  Public API:

 *     Size of the dictionary in bytes, 0 when no dictionary is in use.
 * @var zxc_stream_ctx_t::dict_huf

/**
 * @brief Asynchronous writer thread function.
 *
 * This function runs as a separate thread responsible for writing processed
 * data chunks to the output file. It operates on a ring buffer of jobs shared
 * with the reader and worker threads.
 *
 * **Ordering Enforcement:**
 * The writer MUST write blocks in the exact order they were read. Even if
 * worker threads finish jobs out of order (e.g., job 2 finishes before job 1),
 * the writer waits for `ctx->write_idx` (job 1) to be `JOB_STATUS_PROCESSED`.
 *
 * **Workflow:**
 * 1. **Wait:** Sleeps on `cond_writer` until the job at `ctx->write_idx` is
 * ready.
 * 2. **Write:** Writes the `out_buf` to the file.
 * 3. **Release:** Sets the job status to `JOB_STATUS_FREE` and signals
 * `cond_reader`, allowing the main thread to reuse this slot for new input.
 * 4. **Advance:** Increments `ctx->write_idx` to wait for the next sequential
 * block.
 *
 * @param[in] arg Pointer to a `writer_args_t` structure containing the stream
 * context, the output file handle, and a counter for total bytes written.
 * @return Always returns NULL.

/**
 * @brief Allocates the job ring and starts the workers and the writer.
 *
 * **Architecture: Producer-Consumer with Ring Buffer**
 * - **Ring Buffer:** A fixed-size array of `zxc_stream_job_t` structures.
 * - **Producer (Main Thread):** Reads chunks from `f_in` and fills "Free" slots
 *   in the ring buffer. It blocks if no slots are free (backpressure).
 * - **Workers:** Pick up "Filled" jobs from a queue, process them, and mark
 * them as "Processed".
 * - **Consumer (Writer Thread):** Waits for the *next sequential* job to be
 *   "Processed", writes it to `f_out`, and marks the slot as "Free".
 *
 * **Double-Buffering & Zero-Copy:**
 * We allocate `alloc_in` and `alloc_out` buffers for each job. The reader reads
 * directly into `in_buf`, and the writer writes directly from `out_buf`,
 * minimizing memory copies.
 *
 * **Regular-file Input (decompression):**
 * Small blocks travel several to a job (@c ZXC_STREAM_BATCH_BYTES); with two
 * threads or more, larger ones are read by the workers and all `n_threads`
 * decode. Pipes and memory streams keep one block per job through `fread`.
 *
 * The caller fills the run's fields of @c e->ctx (mode, level, block size,
 * checksums, dictionary, progress) and of @c e->w (output, seek table, counters).
 *
 * @param[in] n_threads Thread count; 0 or less auto-detects the online processors.
 * @return @ref ZXC_OK, or @ref ZXC_ERROR_MEMORY with nothing left to free.
